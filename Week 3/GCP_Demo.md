# GCP Demo (Analyzing NYC Taxi data)

We will be exploring and applying a common Machine Learning Algorithm to the NYC Taxi data with BigQuery

## Create a BigQuery dataset

* Use the button "CREATE DATASET"
* Make a datset with id "taxi"

## Create model

```
CREATE or REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS

WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
  ```
  
## Evaluate classification model performance

Now that training is complete, you can evaluate how well the model performs with this query using ML.EVALUATE. Copy and paste the following into the query editor and click Run:

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model,
  (

  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

  ))
```

## Predict taxi fare amount

Next you will write a query to use your new model to make predictions. Copy and paste the following into the Query editor and click Run:

```
#standardSQL
SELECT
*
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `taxi.taxifare_model`,
   (

 WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips

));
```

## Retraining the model with some feature engineering

```
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL taxi.taxifare_model_2
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['total_fare']) AS


WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),

  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),

  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2) + POW(( pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as dist, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off
    SQRT(POW((pickup_longitude - dropoff_longitude),2)) as longitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in longitude
    SQRT(POW((pickup_latitude - dropoff_latitude), 2)) as latitude, #Euclidean distance between pickup and drop off in latitude
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
WHERE trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount BETWEEN 6 and 200
    AND pickup_longitude > -75 #limiting of the distance the taxis travel out
    AND pickup_longitude < -73
    AND dropoff_longitude > -75
    AND dropoff_longitude < -73
    AND pickup_latitude > 40
    AND pickup_latitude < 42
    AND dropoff_latitude > 40
    AND dropoff_latitude < 42
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.TRAIN
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
```

## Evaluate new model

```
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse

  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model_2,
  (

    SELECT
